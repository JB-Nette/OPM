    "### Setup homebuilt galvo/laser controller\n",
    "Our galvo/laser controller is a [Teensy 3.5](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) with a [12-bit bi-phasic DAC](https://www.tindie.com/products/visgence/power-dac-module/). The PCB design and controller software are found in this repo. The controller performs the following,\n",
    "1. Waits for camera exposure out signal. This signal is sent when all rows are exposing\n",
    "2. Activates laser while galvo sits just outside FOV\n",
    "3. Sweeps galvo across the FOV, covering the entire FOV once during exposure time. The 12-bit DAC board we use requires 4.5 us to achieve a full change, so we calculate the number of possible lines using this. In reality, the unit performs better  than this for small changes, but we get sufficient resolution with this method even for 1 ms exposures.\n",
    "4. Blanks laser at end of sweep, which is also just outside FOV.\n",
    "5. Returns galvo to initial position once laser is blanked.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot sweep the mirror back and forth, because there is a slight skew to the data due to the combination of the galvo sweep + constant stage scan. At slow stage speeds with ca. <2 pixel displacement between images, this is not visible. But, as the stage speed increases, we have to correct for this skew in the post processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach eliminates motion blur and limits shadowing. Inspiration for this approach was taken from various papers, especially [IsoView](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3632) by the Keller lab and our previous work on [interia-free light sheet](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-00514-7). The galvo/laser controller used here is a modified version of the custom DAC solution used in our previous works. Because the Coherent OBIS laser box has 50 Ohm inputs, additional circuitry is needed to drive the digital lines using the 3.3V Teensy."

    "## Run acquisition\n",
    "We don't use the built-in multi-dimensional acquisition. This is because,\n",
    "1. We acquire events as the \"z\" position within pycromanager, but these events are actually positions of the scan axis (x).\n",
    "2. The acquisition during any given tile scan {1 fluidics round (r), 1 height axis position (zstage) , 1 tile axis position (y) , 1 channel (c), N scan axis images (x)} is completely hardware triggered. All pycromanager does is acquire each image and store it to a SSD array as fast as possible.\n",
    "3. We may change the height axis position (zstage) independent of the \"z\" acquisition parameter given by the scan axis (x) to image samples larger than the Rayleigh length of the oblique light sheet.\n",
    "4. We may change the exposure time between different channels, which changes the scan axis (x) and galvo/laser controller (c) parameters.\n",
    "5. We need to make sure the tile axis (y) has returned to initial position before starting again.\n",
    "6. Our ASI Tiger controller (x,y,zstage) often exhibits serial communication problems. So we make sure that the command is received and executed before continuing.\n",
    "7. We use a custom galvo/laser controller (c) that does not fit into the definition of Micromanager 2.0 sequenceable hardware. Our approach eliminates motion blur during a stage scan and reduces shadowing.\n",
    "8. Our Numba deskewing and BDV H5 creation code requires each strip scan {1 fluidics round (r), 1 height axis position (zstage) , 1 tile axis position (y) , 1 channel (c), N scan axis images (x)} to be in it's own file and/or directory.\n",
    "9. We may run an external fluidics controller (r) after a complete volume scan for iterative rounds of labeling."
